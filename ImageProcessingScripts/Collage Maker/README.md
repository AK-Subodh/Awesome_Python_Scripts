## Description: 
This is a Python Script which take two images from user and make a collage of it. In this script we are using **Pillow** and **Numpy**.
- **Pillow**: 
  - The Python Imaging Library adds image processing capabilities to your Python interpreter.
  - This library provides extensive file format support, an efficient internal representation, and fairly powerful image processing capabilities.
  - The core image library is designed for fast access to data stored in a few basic pixel formats. It should provide a solid foundation for a general image processing tool.
- **Numpy**:
  - NumPy is a Python library used for working with arrays.
  - It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
  - NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

## Procedure to be followed:
- pip install **Pillow**
- Then we have to give the path of two images which has to be collaped.
- After that we have to provide the final path of the collaped image.
- Finally, the Output Image will be saved at the given location provided by the user.
