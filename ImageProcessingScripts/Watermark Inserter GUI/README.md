# Watermark Inserter GUI

This GUI prompts you to select two images, one of them a logo or watermark text preferably and your main image.

The chosen watermark image will then get re-sized to 150 pixels by 150 pixels and inserted in the bottom right corner 
of your main image.

The new image will be saved into the images folder.
