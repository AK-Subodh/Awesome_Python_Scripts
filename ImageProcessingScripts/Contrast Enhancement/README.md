# Contrast enhancement image

Using the histogram equalization, we can enhance the contrast in low contrast images. This algorithm uses the cummulative distribution function to map the intensities of a low distribuited histogram into a one more spreaded. Have a look to this [explanation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histogram_equalization)
