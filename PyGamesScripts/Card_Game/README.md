# Card game
## This is a simple card game built using object oriented programming with python.

# Instructions
1. There are two players in this game. Each player gets half a deck(26 cards)
2. In each round the players put out 1 card and the values of the cards are compared.
3. the player with the higher value gets both the cards.
4. Incase both the values are equal, there is a WAR.
5. When at war compare the last card in the deck of each player and repeat steps 2 and 3.
6. The first player to have less than 5 cards loses the game.
NOTE: This is a simple non responsive game, hence both the players are computer bots.
