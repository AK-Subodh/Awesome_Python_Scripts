# PDF to Audio Book Converter

This script works on converting the text in a PDF into audio. It allows the text to be read out.

### Libraries used :

- PyPDF2 -- Used for basic operations on PDFs.
- pyttsx3 -- Used for text to speech conversion.

### Working :

The location of the PDF should be given in the code. Here 'sample.pdf' is used for the demonstration. When the code starts running, a message stating the audio has started is printed on the terminal. The text is read out line by line.
