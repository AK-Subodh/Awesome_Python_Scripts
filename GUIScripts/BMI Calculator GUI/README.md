# BMI Calculator GUI

## Description:
Here with the help of tkinter module I had designed a helpful system for calculating the Body Mass Index Ratio. The user will enter his/her age, gender, height(in cm) and weight(in kg). The system will calculate and show the BMI of the person and will also tell that the person is underweight, healthy or overweight.

## Input:
